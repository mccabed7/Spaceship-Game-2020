# Spaceship-Game-2020
This is a game I created during the summer of fifth year in secondary school in Unity using C#.<br/>
All the art and sounds assets are of my own creation, as well as the C# game-logic scripts of course. <br/>
## Running the game
Working Android scripts can be found in the "Spaceship Game/Builds" folder. <br/>
Otherwise a valid installation of the Unity editor is needed to run the game.
## Demo Video
A gameplay video can be found at the following link: https://youtube.com/shorts/jKUWjJRneWE?feature=share <br/>
The video can also be found in the "Demo Video" folder
